# Pollution Data Analytics

The Jupyter notebook is aims to perform analysis on the pollution data from year 2000 to 2016 for different cities and states in USA . The goal is to deduce which cities have performed well over time and which have performed worse based on each gas emission levels (Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone, Sulphur dioxide, and Carbon Monoxide). In the end we add some interactive plots for yearly emission data. The interactive features in this plot include zoom in/out, hovering to get information and spanning over the plot. 

The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed  from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution

Reasonable explanations via the usage of markdown and python comments has been provided in the notebook.


##  Installing packages/libraries
The packages used in the code are <em>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pylab, plotly, and geopy</em>. While some of these are in-built in Python, others can be installed using <em>pip command</em>:

- <code>pip install seaborn</code>
- <code>pip install pylab</code>
- <code>pip install plotly</code>
- <code>pip install geopy</code>

Alternatively, they all can be installed from Anacondas Navigator. 

## Important Note Regarding Interactive Plots
Note that, if you are just viewing the notebook from Github, the interactive plots will not be visible. One will have to run the notebook locally or on Google Collab in order to actually see and create more plots. If  interested in just viewing and playing with the plots, one can check out the HTML files of the notebook as well as each individual plot. 

## Running the Jupyter Notebook
One has to open the Jupyter notebook and then just run every cell by pressing <code>shift + return</code>.
